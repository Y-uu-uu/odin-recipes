    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These ranch chicken tacos are a great change from regular Mexican-style tacos. A quick, cool summer dinner made with leftover rotisserie chicken. Naturally, you can use any type of chicken cooked the way you like; just be sure to shred it for real tacos.</h2>

        <li>¼ cup reduced-fat sour cream</li>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <li><strong>Step 2</strong><br>Toss chicken with remaining taco seasoning. Cover bowl loosely with wax paper or plastic wrap. Microwave chicken until chicken is heated through, about 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong><br>Warm tortillas in a skillet for about a minute on each side to make them pliable. Place a scoop of chicken on the tortilla and top with lettuce, tomato, green onion, olives, avocado, cheese, and a spoonful of the ranch dressing mixture.</li>
